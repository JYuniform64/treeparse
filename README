# LeetCode Cpp Tree Parser
This little tool parses LeetCode C++ binary tree input into a tree structure `TreeNode` which is also defined in LeetCode, helping you to debug LeetCode problems in your local environment.

## Usage
Include "treeParser.hpp" in your program and call `int parseLeetCodeBinaryTree(std::string& rawString, TreeNode** pRoot)`.

If you would like to free the free manually, call `void cleanTreeNode(TreeNode* root)` after you finish using the tree.
